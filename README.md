It was a job interview work that i developed to know what i was able to do and what i should improve on my coding skills.
I had a lot of conditionals to develop and i was stuck in some SQL statements and since then i haven't worked on that. 
I'm uploading here because i want to finish this project, this will help me develop my coding skills.
